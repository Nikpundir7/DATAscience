    "\n",

    "\n",
    "Q3. What is DML? Explain INSERT, UPDATE, and DELETE with an example.\n",
    "\n",
    "DML is stands for 'Data Manipulation Language'.DML command is used to change the data present in sql database. we can easily access,store,modify,update,and delete the existing record from the database using DML command.\n",
    "\n",
    "INSERT: INSERT command is uset to insert the data in the existing table. Example: insert into student(stu_id,stu_name) values(001,\"bhanu\");\n",
    "\n",
    "UPDATE: update command is used to update existing data within a table. Example: update student set stu_name=\"ram\" where stu_id=001;\n",

    "DELETE: delete command is used to delete records from a database table. Example: delete from student where stu_id=001;\n",
    "\n",
    "Q4. What is DQL? Explain SELECT with an example.\n",
    "\n",
    "DQL stands for 'Data Query Language'.This command allows getting the data out from the database to perform operation Example: select emp_name from employee where age>20;\n",

    "\n",
    "An exception is an event, which occurs during the execution of a program that disrupts the normal flow of the program's instructions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Error in Python can be of two types i.e. Syntax errors and Exceptions. Errors are the problems in a program due to which the program will stop the execution. On the other hand, exceptions are raised when some internal events occur which changes the normal flow of the program.\n",
    "\n",
    "Syntax Error: As the name suggests this error is caused by the wrong syntax in the code. It leads to the termination of the program. Exceptions: Exceptions are raised when the program is syntactically correct, but the code resulted in an error. This error does not stop the execution of the program, however, it changes the normal flow of the program.\n",
